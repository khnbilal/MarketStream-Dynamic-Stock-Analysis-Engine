An end-to-end data pipeline processes real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka and AWS. The project involves simulating stock market data with Python and Boto3, streaming it into Kafka topics hosted on Amazon EC2 instances.

The data is processed and cleaned in real-time using Kafka consumers and Python scripts. Automated ETL processes with AWS Glue significantly reduce the need for manual intervention and enhance the efficiency of the data pipeline.

To ensure scalability and reliability, pipeline performance is monitored and optimized using AWS CloudWatch.
